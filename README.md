The Aegis Guard system is an analog emergency, gas-integrated safety framework designed for multi-hazard detection and response. It incorporates four primary sensors — the MQ-2 gas sensor for smoke and alcohol, the LM35 temperature sensor for thermal monitoring, an IR sensor for intrusion detection, and an IR flame sensor for fire detection. Outputs from the MQ-2 and LM35 are processed through comparators to check threshold exceedance, while an AND gate monitors simultaneous smoke and heat to indicate a potential fire. A 555 timer IC in astable mode generates hazard-specific acoustic alerts by modulating the duty cycle, enabling differentiation between events. MOSFET-driven actuators control auxiliary responses, including a cooling fan for ventilation, while a microcontroller drives an MG90S servo motor to operate a miniature fire-extinguisher mechanism. This mechanism activates either on direct flame detection or when smoke and heat are detected together, ensuring reliable fire suppression. The system’s multi-sensor fusion and dual-condition response provide timely hazard recognition, accurate event differentiation, and coordinated emergency action, making it effective for real-time safety monitoring in prototype and experimental environments.
